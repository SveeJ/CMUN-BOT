 ## WARNING
 This project is deprecated now. It runs on old versions of discord.js. It was made to be an on commission project for a large educational institution 
 in Mumbai that used it for several of their events during COVID-19. Now that the MUN is held offline each year, no further work has been done on it and 
 it is now being made public as legacy.
